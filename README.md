# Andrew Ottman's Java Spring Demo Project

This is a demonstration project by me, Andrew Ottman. Its purpose is to demonstrate transferrability of my backend programming skills, primarily C# ASP.NET experience, to a Java + Spring Boot environment.

C# and Java have similarities in syntax, and Java + Spring Boot has similar capabilities to ASP.NET.

## Project Features

- logFeature: An API to demonstrate concurrency with CompleteableFuture. Located at java/com/ottman/javaspringdemo/logFeature. See "LOG README.md" for more information.

## Future Features

- An API demonstrating protecting endpoints with JWT and OAuth

## Other concepts demonstrated

- Industry standard project structure
- Dependency injection
- Asynchronous communication through documentation
